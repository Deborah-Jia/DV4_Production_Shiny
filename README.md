This is the home assignment for CEU course [Data Visualization 4: Data Visualization in Production with Shiny](https://courses.ceu.edu/courses/2020-2021/data-visualization-4-data-visualization-production-shiny). The data is retetrieved from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-14). Main files include:

* App.R, with both ui and server scripts.
* global.R (in helper_function folder), with helpful functions to collect the data, create plots and tables and support the execution of App.R.

Thank you.
